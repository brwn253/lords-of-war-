# Tier System & Deck Building Rules

## Tier System

Cards can be combined on the battlefield to create higher-tier versions. When you play a duplicate card of the same tier, they merge and tier up.

### Tier Progression:
- **T1 + T1 = T2** (2 cards total)
- **T2 + T2 = T3** (4 cards total)
- **T3 + T3 = T4** (8 cards total)
- **T4 + T4 = T5** (16 cards total)

**Answer: It takes 16 T1 cards to make a T5 card.**

### How It Works:
1. Play a T1 card → It enters the battlefield as T1
2. Play another T1 of the same card → They combine into T2 (stats add together)
3. Play another T2 of the same card → They combine into T3
4. Continue until T5 (maximum tier)

### Example:
- **Archer** (T1): 2/2
- **Archer** (T2): 4/4 (2x T1 combined)
- **Archer** (T3): 8/8 (2x T2 combined)
- **Archer** (T4): 16/16 (2x T3 combined)
- **Archer** (T5): 32/32 (2x T4 combined) - Maximum tier!

## Deck Building Rules

### Deck Size Limit
- **Maximum deck size: 60 cards**
- Decks must contain exactly 60 cards to be saved

### Max Copies Per Card
- **Maximum copies per card: 3**
- You can only include up to 3 copies of any single card in your deck
- This prevents decks from being too focused on a single strategy
- Note: With max 3 copies, you cannot create a T5 card in a single deck (would need 16 copies)

### Visual Indicators
- Cards show `(x2/3)` when you have 2 copies in deck
- Cards show `(x3/3)` when you've reached the max copies limit
- Cards turn red when max copies is reached
- Deck builder shows "Max copies (3)" message when limit is hit

### Why These Limits?
- **60 cards**: Ensures deck variety and prevents games from being too predictable
- **3 copies max**: Balances consistency with variety, prevents overpowered single-card strategies
- **T5 requires 16 copies**: Encourages strategic deck building - you'd need to combine cards across multiple games or use different strategies
